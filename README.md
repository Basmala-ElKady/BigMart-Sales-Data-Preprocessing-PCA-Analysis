# 📊 BigMart Sales Data Preprocessing & PCA Analysis

<div align="center">
A comprehensive Jupyter notebook for cleaning retail sales data, fixing inconsistencies, and applying Principal Component Analysis to reduce dimensionality and extract sales insights
</div>

### Problem
Retail sales datasets contain missing values, inconsistent categories, and outliers.  
High feature count makes analysis and modeling harder.  
Sales prediction suffers without clean data.

### Solution
A complete preprocessing pipeline in one Jupyter notebook.  
Includes EDA, cleaning, encoding, scaling, and PCA.  
Produces clear visual outputs for analysis and reporting.

### Idea
Reduce more than ten numerical and categorical features into a few principal components.  
Preserve most data variance.  
Prepare data for machine learning models.
